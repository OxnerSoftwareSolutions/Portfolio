          About Benji
        </h2>
        <p>I am a software engineer living in Atlanta, Georgia. After graduating North Georgia Technical College for welding, I worked for someone else for around 15 years. 
          It's been something that I have loved and enjoyed for most of my life. As I was working in the sheet metal industry I started
     to play around with some of the computers. The whole time I was on the computer I was having as much fun as I was in the shop welding on things. It was after I had started my own business as a welder that I decided to step out and start my career as a Software Engineer.</p>

    <p>As a student at <b>Thinkful</b>, I've begun my journey to becoming a Software Developer and I couldn't be happier. I'm really happy with my progress and know that there is still much to offer and much to do.</p>

<p>If you're looking to hire a new developer please reach out! I'm so excited to work with other developers to build great software</p>

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <h3>
      <p> As a former welder, I'm interested in:</p>   
      <!-- An unorganized list containing my interests-->
       <ul>
         <li>Web designs that are explanatory enough that maybe future generations can weld onto the code I've laid down and will improve it</li>
         <li>Coding blocks that can be put together to showcase this beautiful sculpted reality that we can only imagine in our dreams</li>
         <li>And as a welder we like things hot, so I want to design and make some of the hottest new trends, 
          come up with something new that is going to rock the world</li>
         </ul>

        <h2>
          About Benji
        </h2>
  <p>After graduating North Georgia Technical College for welding I have had a wonderful career as a welder. It's been something that I have loved and enjoyed for most of my life. As I was working in the sheet metal industry I started to play around with some of the computers. Working on some SolidWorks 3d Models, learning to do CamWorks for machining and the whole time I was on the computer I was having as much fun as I was in the shop welding on things. It was after I had started my own business as a welder that I decided to step out and start my career as a Software Engineer.</p>

    <p>As a student at Thinkful, I've begun my journey to becoming a Software Developer and I couldn't be happier. I'm really happy with my progress and know that there is still much to offer and much to do.</p>

<p>If you're looking to hire a new developer please reach out! I'm so excited to work with other developers to build great software</p>

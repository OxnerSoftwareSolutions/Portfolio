    <h2>About Benji</h2>
       <p>I am a software engineer living in Atlanta, Georgia. After graduating North Georgia Technical College for welding, I worked for someone else for around 15 years. 
       It's been something that I have loved and enjoyed for most of my life. As I was working in the sheet metal industry I started
       to play around with some of the computers. The whole time I was on the computer I was having as much fun as I was in the shop welding on things. It was after I had started my own business as a welder that 
       I decided to step out and start my career as a Software Engineer.</p>

       <p>As a student at <b>Thinkful</b>, I've begun my journey to becoming a Software Developer and I couldn't be happier. I'm really happy with my progress and know that there is still much to offer and much to do.</p>

       <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer please reach out! I'm so excited to work with other developers to build great software</p>
